Hello! This is an addon to another mod that I can't publish because of copyright reasons and size. 
This mod is for Stardew Valley! It is mostly a joke mod. Use the Chaosaddon folder inside as the mod.

This will add...

Events! Can happen randomly and effect your playthrough. Can be a whole host of things.

Curses! You can be stuck with a variety of curses, which will effect your playthrough.

New items! Some are not available because of their reliance on the connected mod, but some are available.

New descriptions and prices for items! Yes I made a lot of things uh.. expensive.

Plus a mechanic that increases luck and damage for clicking along the BPM. However, this goes with the modded XWB bank, so it won't really work for the original ost.
(This mod does use Harmony Patching for the Catbulb item.)
